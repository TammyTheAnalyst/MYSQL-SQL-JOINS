# Overview
I learned how to effectively use **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, **RIGHT JOIN**, **CROSS JOIN**, and the **UNION/**UNION ALL** keywords to query relational databases and retrieve meaningful insights from combined datasets.

# Learning Objectives

* I learned how to understand and utilize INNER JOIN to combine rows from two tables where there is a match.
* I developed skills with LEFT JOIN to retrieve all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
* I learned how to apply RIGHT JOIN to retrieve all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left.
* I used CROSS JOIN to create a Cartesian product between two tables.
* I understood and applied UNION and UNION ALL to combine the results of multiple queries, handling duplicates as needed.

By completing this project, I gained the ability to write SQL queries that efficiently combine data, extract insights, and perform complex operations with ease.

# Hands-on Experience
As part of this project, I worked with multiple SQL queries to explore and implement various join operations and set operations. Below, you'll find screenshots of my hands-on experience, including the queries I wrote and the results I achieved.
Each screenshot provides a visual of the process, from writing the SQL commands to analyzing the output, helping to showcase the practical application of INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, CROSS JOIN, and UNION/UNION ALL.

# In this example, I used a RIGHT JOIN to display all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left.

# Here, I demonstrated the use of a CROSS JOIN to create a Cartesian product between two tables

# This screenshot shows how I used the UNION keyword to combine results from two queries, removing duplicates.

# In this example, I used UNION ALL to combine results from multiple queries, including duplicates.
